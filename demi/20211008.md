# Meeting Note 1

## Project: Multimedia_Information_Security_Forensic_and_Privacy
## Date: 2021/10/8

## Discussion:
### Our project
- With the development of social networks, the risk of personal information disclosure is increasingly more significant than ever before due to the rise of live broadcasting. The key information of individuals, such as portrait and plate numbers, often appears in others' online videos. In previous works, some techniques blurred the entire background and only remained the host's key feature. We aim to design a neural network model with a high reaction speed that will identify various sensitive information and obfuscate it while maintaining environmental information.
### Key point
- real-time detection, ensuring the algorithm speed
- based on server
### What to do in this project
- Algorithm/ build model
- Live platform interface ( ios + android + webpage) 

## Next Step:
### Do some basic research
- Get basic idea on how this project should work
- What should we prepare for this project
